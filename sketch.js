// In this sketch I want to combine two previous projects:
// I want to use the image processing elements of my ASCII project
// to seed a reaction diffusion gradient. I'll have to scale back
// the number of options outputted from the ASCII processing
// to a simple binary; if the image is light, give it A, if it's
// dark, give it B.
